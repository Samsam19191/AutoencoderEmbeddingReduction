# AutoencoderEmbeddingReduction
A project exploring dimensionality reduction and fine-tuning of FastText word embeddings using autoencoders and Word2Vec. Includes methods for reducing 300-dimensional embeddings to 30 dimensions while preserving semantic quality, along with evaluation techniques like cosine similarity and clustering visualization.
